# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently...
- 👨🏻‍💻 working as a backend/infra engineer at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), where my day-to-day is writing high-througput Java services and authoring reusable Terraform modules to manage infrastructure across the company
- 🔬 building out [my homelab](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/homelab/) (code is [here](https://github.com/ryanrishi/devops/tree/master/ansible))

In previous roles, I've been mostly a backend-leaning-full-stack engineer&mdash; mostly Java (Spring/Spring Boot), Node (Express/Apollo), MySQL, and Ember.js

### Some side projects I've done
- [Loudness Wars](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/loudness-wars) - A closer look at how recorded music has been getting increasingly louder over the past 50 years
- [Letscamp](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/letscamp) - I wrote a bot that texts me when a Yosemite reservation I'm interested in becomes available
- [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/covid-19-dashboard) - Visualize COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States
- [Launchpad](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/launchpad) - A side project I did at work to showcase innovation at the company as part of a new corporate website launch

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- [@apollo](https://github.com/apollographql)
- [@nextjs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) — trying to use this to automate my [homelab](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/homelab) even further

### 🤓 Outside of coding...
- ✈️ getting my private pilot license
- 🥁 [I play drums and arrange/perform percussion covers of songs](https://www.youtube.com/user/RyanRishiPercussion)
- 🥘 I like cooking. I've been called the pasta prince and the spaghetti king 🤴🏻
