# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently...
- 👨🏻‍💻 working as a backend-leaning-full-stack engineer&mdash; mostly Node, Express, Apollo, and Next.js. In past roles I've worked with Java, Spring, MySQL, Kafka, and Ember.js
- 🔬 building out [my homelab](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/homelab/) (code is [here](https://github.com/ryanrishi/devops/tree/master/ansible))

### Some side projects I've done
- [Loudness Wars](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/loudness-wars) - A closer look at how recorded music has been getting increasingly louder over the past 50 years
- [Letscamp](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/letscamp) - I wrote a bot that texts me when a Yosemite reservation I'm interested in becomes available
- [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/covid-19-dashboard) - Visualize COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States
- [Launchpad](https://ryanrishi.com/projects/launchpad) - A side project I did at work to showcase innovation at the company as part of a new corporate website launch

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
